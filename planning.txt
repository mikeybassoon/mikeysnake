  If snake's health < 30
    Identify closest food
    Call Destination(food_coordinates, current_coordinates
  Else proceed with random move
    If a square has food in it, it is not considered a valid move unless all other routes are blocked
  Destination algorithm(dest_coordinates, current_coordinates)
    Calculate X and Y distances to target
    If either X or Y !=0
      If X blocked
        If Y blocked
          If only route out blocked
            Go random direction
          Else go remaining direction
        Else move Y
      Else move X
