1.0.0 - COMPLETE November 7
  Identify snake's own unique ID
  Snake will check all possible moves to see if they are legal
    If no legal move, go left
  Snake will randomly select a direction from legal directions

1.0.1
  New expression of routing algorithm
    Upon receipt of board, make list of all unobstructed spaces

  Check if there is a set path for the snake to follow
    If yes, check if anything in that path is obstructed

1.0.2
  Rudimentary algorithm to avoid getting boxed in
    If cavern not large enough, do not enter

1.0.3
  If snake's health < 30
    Identify closest food
    Call Destination(food_coordinates, current_coordinates
  Else proceed with random move
    If a square has food in it, it is not considered a valid move unless all other routes are blocked
  Destination algorithm(dest_coordinates, current_coordinates)
    Calculate X and Y distances to target
    If either X or Y !=0
      If X blocked
        If Y blocked
          If only route out blocked
            Go random direction
          Else go remaining direction
        Else move Y
      Else move X

1.0.4
  Update random path selection to turn away from the closest snake

1.0.5
